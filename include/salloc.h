 * significant bits of values. These methods are needed because we can not
 * simple enumerate sequentially all allocated tuples in the runtime.
 * Some types of indexes (e.g. BITMAP) have better performance if it operates
 * with sequencial offsets (i.e. dense space) instead of pointers(sparse space).
 *
 * The index calculated based on SLAB number and item position within it.
 * Current implementation only guarantees that adjacent chunks from
 * one SLAB will have consecutive indexes. In other words, of two
 * chunks were sequencially allocated from one chunk they will have
 * sequencial ids. If second chunk was allocated from another SLAB th–µn
 * difference between indexes may be more then one.
